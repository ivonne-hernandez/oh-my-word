# [Oh My Word!](https://oh-my-word.herokuapp.com/)

[Oh My Word](https://oh-my-word.herokuapp.com/) is a clone of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). In this game you have six chances to guess the secret five-letter word. Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or arenâ€™t in the word. Unlike Wordle which only allows you to play one word each day, **Oh My Word** allows you to play as many times a day as you want!
